# Hi there, I'm Hamad Alrashidüëã

I'm a passionate undergraduate student who loves to explore new technologies and build innovative projects. I study Computer Science student at the University of Maryland with academic emphasis in ML/AI, Data Science, and Cybersecurity (GPA 3.74). Below are two of my favorite projects that I've worked on. 

## üöÄ Project 1: Using Machine Learning Tokenization in lexical-matching Retrieval Systems at [Vectara.com](Vectara.com), a top-50 GenAI startup, at the Silicon Valley. 

### Describtion
During my 2023 summer internship at Vectara.com, I worked on a 3-month cutting-edge project that improves the Information Retrieval system using Machine Learning. I performed extensive ML experiments & Information Retrieval Question-Answering benchmarking & Hyper-Parameter tuning, outperforming strong baselines such as the mBERT tokenizer.

### Goals of the project
- Goal 1: Understanding the importance of tokenization in lexical-matching retrieval systems  
- Goal 2: Extensive analysis of the [Sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) ML tokenizer (Google, 2018) in BM25 
- Goal 3: Hyper-parameter tuning experiments
- Goal 4: Train a Multilingual Tokenizer that supports 41 languages
- Goal 5: Expand on (Better Than Whitespace: Information Retrieval for Languages without Custom Tokenizers)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05481], a paper by Jimmy Lin's research group at the University of Waterloo
- Goal 6: Improve the effectiveness of the keyword retrieval system
- And more...

### Technologies/Resources Used
- [Sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) : An open-source Machine Learning Tokenizer, developed and maintained by Google. 
- BM25 / TF-IDF: keyword-matching algorithm
- [Pyserini](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini): "toolkit for reproducible information retrieval research with sparse and dense representations"
- Python: Used for writing the benchmarking & training scripts
- [Mr. TiDy](https://aclanthology.org/2021.mrl-1.12.pdf) & [MIRACL](https://github.com/project-miracl/miracl): Mutlilingual QA datasets for benchmarking retrieval systems
- [Wiki40b](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/wiki40b): Wikipedia text of over 84 million sentences of 41 langauges
- [Google Vizier](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vizier/overview): A black-box optimizer that is used for hyper-parameter tuning
- Amazon EC2 Instance: Used a machine with over 700GB of RAM to train the tokenizer
- [SQLITE Full-Text search](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html): A powerfull extenstion that provides a full-text search engines to efficiently search a corpus
